# About me

"Tifosi at heart 🏎️❤️ | Living life a quarter mile (or a full GP lap) at a time. Passionate about the roar of a Ferrari V12, the iconic Rosso Corsa red, and the legacy of racing legends like Schumacher and Leclerc. Whether it’s F1 Sundays or classic car shows, you’ll find me debating aerodynamics or dreaming of the Prancing Horse’s next victory. Forza Ferrari! 🏁"
